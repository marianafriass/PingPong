# Ping Pong Proyect
Ping Pong is a game that requires quick reflexes and precise angle calculations to return the ball accurately to the other side of the table. Creating this game in C++ would not only be entertaining but also help users improve their reaction times. It’s an ideal project because it incorporates various programming concepts we’re learning in class, such as object-oriented programming, loops, and collision detection, making it both educational and fun to develop. Additionally, I can apply physics concepts to create more challenging levels, add scoring mechanisms, and, if possible, include an AI opponent for a more dynamic gameplay experience.
